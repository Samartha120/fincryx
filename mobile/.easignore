# Platform builds (usually re-generated on server, but sometimes needed if prebuild is not used)
# Since we are likely using prebuild or bare workflow (android folder exists), we need to be careful.
# The user's .gitignore has /android and /ios, suggesting Managed workflow or Prebuild.
# IF this is Managed flow, we exclude android/ios.
# THE ISSUE: The user's .gitignore HAS /android and /ios.
# This means these folders are GENERATED and should normally be ignored by EAS if we want a clean managed build.
# HOWEVER, earlier the user had 'local.properties' IN android/, which implies they might rely on the local android folder.
# BUT, the .gitignore shows /android is ignored!
# Wait, if /android is ignored in .gitignore, then it shouldn't have been uploaded to EAS?
# UNLESS 'eas build' respects .easignore over .gitignore or combines them?
# "Files in .gitignore are ignored by default... unless allowed by .easignore"
# If /android is in .gitignore, EAS shouldn't upload it unless forced.
# The fact that 'local.properties' caused an issue suggests that the 'android' folder WAS being uploaded or processed?
# Or maybe the earlier build failure was from a local build or a previous state?
# The user's error logs showed "/home/expo/workingdir/build/mobile/android/..."
# That strongly implies the android project IS being built on the server.
# If .gitignore has /android, then `eas build` shouldn't upload it for a managed project.
# BUT if this is a BARE project (or prebuild committed), /android should NOT be ignored.
# The user's .gitignore has /android. This suggests it should be ignored.
# So why did we have an issue with android/local.properties?
# Maybe the user's .gitignore was NOT being respected or the file was force-added to git previously?
# We verified 'local.properties' status.

# To be safe and reduce size, let's explicitly ignore android/build and ios/build if they exist.
